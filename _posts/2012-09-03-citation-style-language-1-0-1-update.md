title: Citation Style Language 1.0.1 Update

The Citation Style Language (CSL) team is happy to announce CSL 1.0.1.

CSL 1.0.1 is an (almost completely) backwards compatible release, and CSL 1.0 styles and locale files don't have to be updated to work with CSL 1.0.1-compatible software.
CSL 1.0.1 is a relatively minor update, but adds a variety of new features to CSL, and an extra layer of polish to both the specification and schema.
The [CSL 1.0.1 specification](http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html) is accompanied by [CSL 1.0.1 release notes](http://citationstyles.org/downloads/release-notes-csl101.html), which give a comprehensive overview of the changes in this update.

## State of the Union

This is the first update of the CSL schema since the release of CSL 1.0 in 2010.
While CSL development has slowed since the flurry of activity leading up to the release of 1.0, we consider the project to be in great shape.
CSL 1.0 has proven to be a very popular release, and we now have a well-curated collection of over 2500 CSL 1.0 styles, many of which have been contributed by users.
All styles are now available under the permissive Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license.
A redesign of the [Zotero Style Repository](http://www.zotero.org/styles) page has made browsing and searching styles easier.
CSL 1.0 is now supported by [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/), [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/), [Papers](http://www.mekentosj.com/papers/), and [Qiqqa](http://www.qiqqa.com/), and we expect that these programs will support CSL 1.0.1 in the near future.

In addition to Frank Bennett's [citeproc-js](https://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/wiki/Home), used by Zotero, Mendeley, and Qiqqa, there are several other actively maintained open source CSL processors.
The PHP-based [citeproc-php](https://bitbucket.org/rjerome/citeproc-php) by Ron Jerome offers CSL support in Drupal through the [Bibliography Module](http://drupal.org/project/biblio).
The Haskell-based [citeproc-hs](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/citeproc-hs) by Andrea Rossato adds CSL support to the versatile [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) document converter.
Finally, the Ruby-based [citeproc-ruby](https://github.com/inukshuk/citeproc-ruby), by Sylvester Keil, can easily be deployed for the web, and has recently been accepted as a 2012 Google Summer of Code project .

A [collaboration](http://csleditor.wordpress.com/about/) between [Columbia University Libraries](http://library.columbia.edu/) and [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/) is underway to create a more user-friendly CSL editor (although this previously has proven to be quite the challenge).
Another exciting development is the work of Frank Bennett on his forks of Zotero and CSL to revolutionize the field of multilingual and legal citation management, the progress of which can be followed on his website [citationstylist.org](http://citationstylist.org/).
