You can contact the CSL team on Twitter at [@csl_styles](https://twitter.com/csl_styles), or by using the contact form at the bottom of this page. However, there is often a better way to get in touch:

Authors
-------

If you are a user of CSL-based software (such as Zotero, Mendeley, or Papers) and need support with the use of CSL styles, please first use the support channel of your software product.

To request a new CSL style or report style errors, see [Requesting Styles](/authors/#requesting-new-styles).

Developers
----------

To discuss CSL development, use either our [xbiblio-devel mailing list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/xbiblio-devel) ([Nabble mirror](http://xbiblio-devel.2463403.n2.nabble.com/)) or the issue trackers of the [relevant GitHub repositories](https://github.com/citation-style-language/).

Users with CSL feature requests can also use the [Zotero forums](https://forums.zotero.org/), where many missing CSL features already have existing discussions.

Publishers
----------

Please use the form below for any questions. We're always happy to work with publishers, often for free, to create up-to-date CSL styles for all your journals.
