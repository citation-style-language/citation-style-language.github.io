## Credits

The Citation Style Language (CSL) was created by [Bruce D'Arcus](https://twitter.com/bdarcus), and shaped by early contributions from [Simon Kornblith](https://twitter.com/simonsterdotcom) of Zotero.
In recent years [Frank G. Bennett, Jr.](https://twitter.com/fgbjr) and [Rintze M. Zelle](https://twitter.com/rintzezelle) have spearheaded further development.
The CSL _styles_ and _locales_ GitHub repositories are maintained by Rintze Zelle and [Sebastian Karcher](https://twitter.com/adam42smith).

## CSL Supporters

CSL has enjoyed the support of several patrons:

* **[Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/)** -
  Even though CSL and Zotero are independent open source projects, their roots have always been firmly intertwined.
  Zotero was the first program to adopt CSL, with Zotero-developer Simon Kornblith contributing to the core design of CSL.
  Many CSL contributors (including Frank, Rintze, and Sebastian) became aware of CSL through their use of Zotero.
  Our current GitHub _styles_ repository is based on the collection of CSL styles Zotero started, and Zotero-developer Dan Stillman maintains the Zotero Style Repository and CSL's _styles-distribution_ and _distribution-updater_ GitHub repositories.
  Finally, Zotero kindly administers our domain.
* **[Papers](http://www.papersapp.com)** -
  Papers-developer Charles Parnot has contributed many CSL styles (including most of our Springer styles), and Papers ran a "A Serial for a Style" bounty program to reward CSL style contributors with a Papers license.
  In 2015, Springer and Papers donated $5000 to the CSL project.
* **[Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/)** and **[Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com)** -
  Together with Columbia University Libraries, Mendeley obtained an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation grant to create a [CSL style editor](http://editor.citationstyles.org), which was subsequently built by [Steve Ridout](https://twitter.com/Steve_Ridout).
  Mendeley-developer Carles Pina contributed many CSL styles and helped set up the _styles-distribution_ and _distribution-updater_ GitHub repositories.
  Since 2014, Mendeley and Elsevier have yearly donated $5000 to the CSL project.

## Supporting CSL

Looking to support CSL? You can help us in many ways:

* **Star our _styles_ repository on GitHub**.
  If you already have a GitHub account, an easy way to show your appreciation is to [star](https://help.github.com/articles/about-stars/) our [styles repository](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles) (and any other of our repositories you find interesting).
* **Become a CSL style author**.
  Learn CSL, create new CSL styles, and improve existing ones.
  Follow e.g. the [Zotero forums](http://forums.zotero.org/) to find out which styles are being requested, and help users with their CSL questions.
* **Get involved in CSL development**.
  Take part in CSL development.
  Report missing features, help us design and implement new features, write new CSL documentation, or work on the CSL processors.
* **Mention us**.
  If you are a developer and use CSL in your software, please drop us a line and acknowledge the use of CSL in your software (please use the unabbreviated "Citation Style Language", since "CSL" is a common acronym).
  Also, if you distribute CSL styles from our style repository, make sure to comply with their Creative Commons BY-SA license.
* **Financially**.
  We currently aren't set up very well to accept personal donations (e.g., the CSL project is not registered as a non-profit organization).
  However, if you wish to support the open source community around CSL, consider signing up for [Zotero File Storage](http://www.zotero.org/support/storage#zotero_file_storage) (the [preferred way](https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/20922/donating/?Focus=141821#Comment_141821) to donate to Zotero) as a token of appreciation for their continuing contributions to CSL, which includes hosting [CitationStyles.org](http://citationstyles.org/) and the [Zotero Style Repository](http://www.zotero.org/styles).
  Or buy Frank Bennett's book on Multilingual Zotero (MLZ, which has since been rebranded to [Juris-M](https://juris-m.github.io/)), [Citations, Out of the Box: Adapting Zotero for legal and multilingual research](http://www.amazon.com/Citations-Out-Box-Adapting-multilingual/dp/147934771X/).
